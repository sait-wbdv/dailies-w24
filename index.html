    <h1>Marriage and wedding customs in the Philippines </h1>
    <p class="italic"><span> Customs in the Philippines and Filipino wedding practices pertain to the characteristics of marriage and wedding traditions established and adhered by them Filipino men and women in the Philippines after a period of adoption courtship and engagement. These traditions extend to other countries around the world where Filipino communities exist. Kasalan is the Filipino word for "wedding" while its root word kasal means "marriage".The present-day character of marriages and weddings in the Philippines were primarily influenced by the permutation of Christian, both Catholic and Protestant, Hindu,Islam, Chinese, Spanish, and American models.</span></p>
   <strong><em>Historical Overview</em></strong>
    <p style="background-color: blueviolet;"><span>Typical Filipino wedding in pre-colonial times, is held for three days, and was officiated by a babaylan, a tribal priest or priestess. The house of the babaylan was the ritual venue for the nuptials. On the first day, the couple was brought to the priest's home, where the babaylan blessed them as their hands were joined over a container of uncooked rice. On the second day, the priest would prick their chests to draw some blood, which is then collected in a container to be mixed with water. After declaring their love for each other three times, the couple were fed by the priest with cooked rice from a single container. Afterwards, they were to drink the water mixed with their combined blood. The priest proclaimed that the couple were officially wed once their necks and hands were bound by a cord or, sometimes, their long hairs were entwined. In lieu of a babaylan, the reigning datu of the place or a local elder may also officiate.</span></p>

     <p style="background-color: blueviolet;"><span> The ceremony, a series of gift-giving rituals were also done to counter any negative signals from the bride: refusal to ascend the stairs to her new home; denies to participate in the marriage banquet; or enter the bridal chamber.</span></p> 

    <p style="background-color: blueviolet;"><span> Colonialism brought changes to these marriage rituals because of the proselytising by Spanish missionaries, which began in the late 16th century. As a result, the majority of modern Filipino weddings became predominantly Catholic or generally Christian[5] in character, as the Catholic Church remains the predominant religion. Indigenous traditions still exist today in other regions of the Philippines. Parts of Filipino wedding ceremonies have become faith-centered and God-centered, which also highlights the concept that the union of two individuals is a "life long commitment" of loving and caring. Culturally, the marriage does not only signify the union of two persons, but also of their families and extended clans.</span>

      <li>capacity of the contracting parties who must be a male and a female, 25 years old and above without any impediment to get married.</li>
      <li>Consent freely given in the presence of the solemnizing officer.</li>
